# IR Course Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Multimedia and Information Retrieval** course (2024-2025). It focuses on implementing and evaluating an information retrieval (IR) system within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Running the Project
Execute the Jupyter Notebook step by step. This will:
1. Install the necessary dependencies.
2. Load and preprocess the dataset.
3. Build an inverted index.
4. Process queries and evaluate the results using NDCG, Recall, and other standard metrics.
5. Compare the obtained results with those from PyTerrier, a Python framework that leverages the underlying Terrier.org information retrieval toolkit.

# Colab

You can also [execute the notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/giuliocapecchi/IR_project/blob/main/IR_project.ipynb) if you would like to try it out yourself.
